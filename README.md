# UI Portfolio Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is a **Portfolio Website** developed as part of our weekly group challenge. The goal was to design and build a professional, responsive, and clean-looking portfolio site using **HTML** and **CSS** only â€” based strictly on the technologies covered during the week.

## Solution Approach
We approached the project by breaking it down into the following main sections:
- Header: A responsive navigation bar with links and a call-to-action button.
- Hero Section: Introducing the portfolio owner with a hero image and headline.
- About Section: A brief biography including skills, contact information, and downloadable resume button.
- Services Section: A list of offered services using card layouts.
- Skills Section: Visual skill bars representing proficiency.
- Portfolio Section: A responsive image grid showcasing projects.
- Footer:Contact information, social links, and navigation.

We focused heavily on:
- Responsive Design: Ensuring compatibility across devices using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
- Consistent Theming: Reused color palettes and typography across the site.
- Clean Code: All HTML and CSS were written clearly, well-indented, and commented where necessary.
- version Control: Regular commits were made to GitHub to track changes and ensure collaborative development.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)**

> Note: Only technologies taught during the week were used. No JavaScript or external libraries were included.

## Challenges Faced
- Merging individual work into a unified final design without conflicts.
- Ensuring pixel-perfect responsiveness across multiple screen sizes.
